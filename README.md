## Overview
**Sawa** in Arabic means together, and it's a community-based mobile application designed to help users connect, create events, and share their interests through interactive communities.

## Project Description
Sawa is a social platform that brings people together around shared interests. Users can create and join communities, share posts with images, and participate in real-time discussions through a clean, user-friendly interface.

Each community serves as a dedicated hub for collaboration, media sharing, and event participation. Users can interact through group chats, explore and join upcoming events, and receive real-time notifications for new events, messages, and post engagement.

The app also includes:
- Personal profiles displaying user activity
- A unique event streak badge system that rewards engagement (e.g., Explorer, Rising Star, Legend)
- Support for dark mode and bilingual UI (Arabic & English) to enhance accessibility and user experience
